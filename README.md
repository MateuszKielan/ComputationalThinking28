This project is about creating a spotify algorithm for the "Discover weekly feature"
It consists of 3 parts:
  1. In the first part we generate 5 songs based on the songs that user listend to
  2. In the second part we generate 5 songs based on the users favourite genre
  3. In the third part we generate 5 songs based on the users mood
  
File structure:
  spotify_dataset.csv: represents the dataset od the songs that we are working with in the program
  Base.py: is used for dataset handling/cleaning, input/output of the program and connecting several parts of the program togeather
  task1.py | task2.py | task3.py: they correspond to 1st 2nd and 3rd part of the project described above.
